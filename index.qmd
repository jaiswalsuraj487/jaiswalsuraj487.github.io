Welcome to My Portfolio!

Check out my [Resume](https://jaiswalsuraj487.github.io/resume/Suraj_Jaiswal_Resume.pdf) to know more about me.

Currently working as a Data Analyst at [Tiger Analytics](https://www.tigeranalytics.com/). Here, I developed a Multi-agent AI interview orchestrator using LangChain + LangGraph, GenAI pipeline for Bill-of-Materials automation for lighting parts, and engineered an end-to-end Discrete choice modeling framework. 

Worked previously as an NLP Engineer at [Neuroreef Lab](https://www.linkedin.com/company/neuroreef-labs/), dedicated to advancing AI applications in healthcare. Here, I drive the development of [CareCortex](https://carecortex.ai/), an innovative AI copilot that assists doctors in real-time, capturing detailed medical notes aligned with clinical standards. My expertise spans large language models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and automated coding for Medical codes.

<!-- In previous roles, including my internship, I developed robust machine learning pipelines for [Medaura](https://medaura.ai/), an interactive medical Q&A product that draws insights from the extensive PubMed database. -->

My academic journey at IIT Gandhinagar, guided by [Dr. Nipun Batra](https://nipunbatra.github.io/), sharpened my skills in scalable Machine learning. My research on satellite-based detection and compliance monitoring of brick kilns has been published in ACM Compass and NeurIPS 2023, where we developed a scalable YOLO-OBB–based deep learning pipeline to detect and classify 30,000+ brick kilns across 5 Indian states using satellite imagery to achieve 82% precision over 520,000 km² of coverage.

Here, I share technical insights, project highlights, and my exploration of AI's potential to create meaningful, real-world impact.
