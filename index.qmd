Welcome to My Portfolio!

Check out my [Resume](https://jaiswalsuraj487.github.io/resume/Suraj_Jaiswal_Resume.pdf) to know more about me.

Currently working as Data Analyst at Tiger Analytics

Worked previously as NLP Engineer at [Neuroreef Lab](https://www.linkedin.com/company/neuroreef-labs/) dedicated to advancing AI applications in healthcare. Here, I drive the development of [CareCortex](https://carecortex.ai/), an innovative AI copilot that assists doctors in real-time, capturing detailed medical notes aligned with clinical standards. My expertise spans large language models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and automated coding for Medical codes.

In previous roles, including my internship, I developed robust machine learning pipelines for [Medaura](https://medaura.ai/), an interactive medical Q&A product that draws insights from the extensive PubMed database.

My academic journey at IIT Gandhinagar, guided by [Dr. Nipun Batra](https://nipunbatra.github.io/), sharpened my skills in scalable Machine learning. My research on satellite-based detection and compliance monitoring of brick kilns has been published in ACM Compass and NeurIPS 2023, focusing on using deep and active learning for environmental compliance, achieving high accuracy with reduced annotation.

Here, I share technical insights, project highlights, and my exploration of AI's potential to create meaningful, real-world impact. Dive in to discover more about my work and innovations at the intersection of machine learning, healthcare, and environmental sustainability.
