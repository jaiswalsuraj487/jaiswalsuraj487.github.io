    "### Abstract:\n",
    "- Air pollution kills 7 million people annually. The brick manufacturing industry accounts for 8%-14% of air pollution in the densely populated Indo-Gangetic plain. \n",
    "- Due to the unorganized nature of brick kilns, policy violation detection, such as proximity to human habitats, remains challenging. While previous studies have utilized computer vision-based machine learning methods for brick kiln detection from satellite imagery, they utilize proprietary satellite data and rarely focus on compliance with government policies. \n",
    "- In this research, we introduce a scalable framework for brick kiln detection and automatic compliance monitoring. We use Google Maps Static API to download the satellite imagery followed by the YOLOv8 model for detection. \n",
    "- We identified and hand-verified **19579 new brick kilns across 9 states within the Indo-Gangetic plain**. \n",
    "- Furthermore, we automate and test the compliance to the policies affecting human habitats, rivers and hospitals. Our results show that a substantial number of brick kilns do not meet the compliance requirements. Our framework offers a valuable tool for governments worldwide to automate and enforce policy regulations for brick kilns, addressing critical environmental and public health concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In addition, we have deployed our model as a [web application](https://brick-kilns-detector.streamlit.app/) for automatically identifying brick kilns given a specific area by the user.\n",
